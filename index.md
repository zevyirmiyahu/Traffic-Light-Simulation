# Traffic Light Simulation

## Description: 
This is a mini-project that allows a user to input 3 integer durations for light changing. The light durations are for traffic light #1 and specify how long a given 
light will remain on. Traffic light number 2 is then created and rendered to the screen and synchronizes in a way to ensure no two lights are ever green AND yellow at any one time. 
The purpose of this project was to build a mathematical and computer model that can easily simulate various intersections with differing time restrictions. 
The main class builds the main menu that takes user input, then creates an instance of Sync which creates 2 instances of TrafficLight and syncs their light mechanisms based on the user input.
